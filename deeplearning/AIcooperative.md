# Multi-Modal AI Framework for Hybrid Radar/Camera/Lidar Data Fusion and Multi-Station Cooperative Sensing

## Introduction

In the realm of wireless communication and sensing, the convergence of diverse data modalities—such as radar, camera, and lidar—holds immense promise. Our research endeavors focus on developing a novel multi-modal AI framework that seamlessly integrates these data sources. By leveraging both software-defined control and deep learning-based AI processing, our system aims to overcome the limitations of single-device deployments in real-world scenarios.

## System Overview

### Prototype Basestation Device

Our system builds upon the prototype basestation device described in Activity 1. This device combines communication and radar sensing capabilities within a single unit. Key features include:

- **Software-Defined Control:** The basestation device allows dynamic reconfiguration, adapting to varying communication and sensing requirements.
- **Deep Learning-Based AI Processing:** We employ Pytorch and Huggingface Transformers to process raw data efficiently.

### Challenges and Proposition

1. **Coverage and Limitations:**
   - Single devices face constraints in coverage due to limited communication range and sensing capabilities.
   - Power and computing limitations hinder their performance in complex scenarios.

2. **Cooperation Beyond Computation Offloading:**
   - Our proposition extends beyond mere computation offloading.
   - We advocate for synchronized joint sensing and pre-fusion at the raw-data level.

3. **Leveraging Raw Data Information:**
   - By fusing data modalities early in the processing pipeline, we maximize information utilization.
   - Raw data contains rich context that traditional approaches often overlook.

### Research Challenges

1. **Distributed System Co-Design:**
   - Coordinating multiple basestation devices requires robust distributed system design.
   - We address synchronization, data sharing, and fault tolerance.

2. **Early Fusion Models:**
   - Our framework integrates diverse data types (radar, camera, lidar) at an early stage.
   - Early fusion enhances detection reliability and resilience.

3. **High-Speed, Low-Latency Data Sharing:**
   - Efficient data exchange between stations demands low latency.
   - We explore mechanisms for real-time collaboration.

### Our 3D Detection Framework

1. **Data Types Integration:**
   - Our framework incorporates 2D and 3D data from radar, camera, and lidar.
   - This holistic approach improves detection accuracy.

2. **Synchronized and Asynchronized Fusion Paths:**
   - We implement multiple fusion paths at different stages.
   - Synchronized fusion ensures real-time coordination, while asynchronized paths optimize performance.

3. **Flexible Model Selection:**
   - Researchers can swap individual deep learning models without architectural constraints.
   - This flexibility encourages innovation and experimentation.
